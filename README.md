# Tour of C# (fundamentals).

This Repo consists of a GradeBook application that processes grades, stores them in a txt.file (locally) and calculates an average based on this. 

The application is built with the purpose of serving as a personal source of reference for topics, syntax and semantics that are fundamental to C# development. - built with the help of docs, tutorials & courses. 

See the [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) for more useful and explanatory resources!
